A quiz app that made for a project with my coding program. I had to make a responsive quiz application to show my working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This project and my vision were to make a minimalist design quiz app that's fun, simple, and aesthetically pleasing to the eye; and also user-friendly.
